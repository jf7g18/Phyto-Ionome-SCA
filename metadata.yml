    description: >
      Main R script for a Critical Methods Initiative (CMI) pipeline to process LA-TOF-ICP-MS data and derive 
      single-cell phytoplankton ionomes (normalized to P). Uses a U-Net neural network model for semantic 
      segmentation of individual cells from microscopy images.
